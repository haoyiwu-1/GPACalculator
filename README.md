# GPACalculator
This is a very basic GPA calculator to help calculate GPAs on two different scales. The two scales are the commonly used 4.0 scale and the one used by my university the 9.0 scale.
## Usage
To use this GPA calculator go to https://haoyiwu-1.github.io/GPACalculator/ . The range of values for the course grade input is between 0 and 100, whereas the range for the course weight input is between 1 and 100. To add a course simply click the "Add Course" button. To reset/restart the calculator click the reset button.
